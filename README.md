# SugarBeetRobot
Statistical analysis of sensor data from an agricultural robot using analysis on RGB and near-infrared (NIR) images.
uses data collected by an agricultural robot developed at the University of Bonn. 
The full dataset with description is available here: http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/sugarbeets2016/ and the associated article is (Chebrolu, Nived and Lottes, Philipp and Schaefer, Alexander and Winterhalter, Wera and Burgard, Wolfram and Stachniss, Cyrill, 2017).
This robot was fitted with a camera and RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, and Depth) sensor to image the plants on the field (and many other sensors to track its position).
The camera recorded both RGB images and near infrared (NIR) emission.  

A project brief along with the Python project file has been uploaded.
